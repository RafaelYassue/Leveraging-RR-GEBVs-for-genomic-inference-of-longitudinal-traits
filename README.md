# Leveraging-RR-GEBVs-for-genomic-inference-of-longitudinal-traits
This repo contains all the code and data used for the manuscript: "Leveraging breeding values obtained from random regression models for genetic inference of longitudinal traits". It builds off the approach used for our 2018 Plant Direct paper where we used RR for genomic prediction of shoot growth trajectories.
